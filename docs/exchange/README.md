# Exchange Architecture and Concepts

## Boundary

The `exchange` module is a standalone SDK-backed conversion layer with its own
public contracts. It gives applications one normalized API across venue SDKs.
It does not route through `adapter/*` or `runtime/*`, and those packages do not
define exchange API behavior.

The boundary is intentionally narrow:

- `exchange` owns normalized request, result, error, acknowledgement, and
  subscription models.
- `exchange/factory` owns typed venue/product construction and environment
  validation.
- `exchange/internal/factoryclient` translates the public contracts to the
  selected SDK without exposing native payloads.
- Adapter and runtime documentation may explain other repository layers, but it
  is not evidence for this module's behavior.

## Construction and lifecycle

Each venue/product constructor returns a sealed `factory.Config[C]` ticket.
`factory.New` validates that ticket and returns either an
`exchange.SpotClient` or `exchange.PerpClient`. The generic result keeps the
product-specific method set at compile time; callers do not perform runtime
feature discovery.

Construction is local. It validates credentials, explicit environment, and
endpoint options, then wires SDK clients without network I/O. The first REST
method or WebSocket watch/command performs the first exchange I/O. `Close`
releases client-owned WebSocket resources and is safe before a connection was
opened.

Environment selection is optional. `factory.EnvironmentLive` selects production
endpoints, it is the only environment, and it is the default, so a constructor
rejects any other value. Demo and testnet profiles were removed because each
venue implemented them differently. Anonymous product access is read-only and
uses live public venue data instead.

## Credential-free public reads

Current derivative facts and settled funding history need no credential.
`factory.NewPublicDerivativeFeed` constructs an `exchange.DerivativeFeed` for
one native market family and one or more route projections. A single broad
venue snapshot or stream can therefore produce funding, mark, index, and OI
patches for USDT and USDC routes without opening the native feed twice.
Adapters whose native ticker carries several derivative fields may additionally
implement `exchange.DerivativeReferenceWebSocket`; Gateway uses it as one rich
hot stream while ordinary `PerpWebSocket` callers remain source compatible.

`factory.NewPublicFundingHistoryConnector` remains the request-driven path for
one instrument's settled funding points within the bounds carried by
`exchange.FundingHistoryRequest`. Both paths are built from public catalog
identity — venue, product, environment, and settlement — and never receive an
API key, secret, or account.

Snapshots and patches validate identity before entering the normalized fact
store, so an adapter cannot quietly publish another venue or route. A venue
that publishes no history returns `exchange.ErrUnsupported`, which keeps the
absence a documented answer rather than an empty series.

## Typed product surfaces

The public interfaces encode the Spot/Perp intersection directly:

| Facet | Spot | Perp | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `exchange.MarketREST` | embedded | embedded | Instruments, books, candles, and public trades |
| `exchange.OrderREST` | embedded | embedded | Place, cancel, open orders, history, and fills |
| `exchange.SpotAccountREST` | embedded | absent | Balances and Spot account |
| `exchange.PerpAccountREST` | absent | embedded | Balances, Perp account, and positions |
| `exchange.PerpREST` | absent | embedded | Funding and leverage |
| `exchange.SpotWebSocket` | returned | embedded by Perp | Public/private Spot streams and order commands |
| `exchange.PerpWebSocket` | absent | returned | Spot streams plus positions and Perp reference streams |

`exchange.SpotClient` therefore cannot call position, funding, or leverage
methods. `exchange.PerpClient` adds those methods without adding a capability
registry or a `has`/`features` negotiation layer.

## Normalized data and instruments

Spot and perpetual products have separate compile-time method sets. Instruments
use normalized exchange identifiers at the public boundary; native market IDs,
token indices, contract counts, and scaled integers remain inside the SDK
translation.

Every network method accepts `context.Context`. Prices, quantities, balances,
fees, funding rates, and other exact numeric values use `decimal.Decimal` or an
explicit optional-decimal wrapper. Models never require callers to parse native
JSON or depend on venue SDK structs.

History and market-data pages preserve only the pagination facts the venue can
prove. A missing cursor or unknown `HasMore` value is not evidence that account
history is complete.

## Order lifecycle

REST and WebSocket order commands share `exchange.PlaceOrderRequest`:

- market orders have quantity but no limit price or limit policy;
- limit orders require a positive price and one of resting, IOC, or post-only;
- `ReduceOnly` is valid only for Perp;
- `ClientOrderID` is a required portable positive decimal `uint48` string; and
- cancellation uses the opaque `OrderID` returned by the selected row.

Commands return `exchange.OrderAcknowledgement`, not a guessed final order.
Accepted-pending, resting, partial-fill, immediate-fill, canceled, rejected, and
ambiguous states preserve what the venue response actually proves. An
ambiguous send must be reconciled by its original correlation identifiers
before a replacement write is attempted.

## WebSocket lifecycle

`WebSocket()` returns a lazy typed facet. Each watch returns
`exchange.Subscription[T]` with an opaque ID plus `Events`, `Status`, `Errors`,
and an idempotent `Close`. Startup failures return from the watch call;
asynchronous failures arrive on `Errors`. Status events distinguish connecting,
active, gap, resyncing, and closed states.

Most interface members are implemented by all admitted rows. A documented
venue exception returns `exchange.ErrUnsupported` from the method itself rather
than removing that method from the public intersection.

## Brokered clients

A brokered client trades other venues' order books from one account. Gate
CrossEx (`factory.CrossExPerpConfig`) is the only one. It returns an ordinary
`exchange.PerpClient` and additionally implements `exchange.BrokeredClient`,
which callers discover by type assertion.

This is a deliberate exception to "a client publishes only its own venue's
instruments":

- Instruments keep the identity of the venue whose book they trade. A Binance
  BTC-USDT order placed through CrossEx is `VenueBinance` / `BTC-USDT`, the
  same instrument a native Binance client trades. Only `NativeSymbol`
  (`BINANCE_FUTURE_BTC_USDT`) and `Rules` (CrossEx's own tick, lot, minimum
  size and notional) differ. `Reaches()` lists the venue markets allowed.
- The broker venue (`exchange.VenueCrossEx`, `exchange.IsBroker`) never
  identifies an instrument. It owns what belongs to the account: errors,
  credentials, rate limits, and the private stream's `AccountRoute.Venue`.
  One account stream carries events for every reachable venue.
- Market data is read from the instrument's own venue. The brokered client's
  market methods return `exchange.ErrUnsupported`: CrossEx publishes no
  history and forwards each venue's native size units.
- Order acknowledgements are `AckAcceptedPending`: CrossEx accepts
  asynchronously and the order may still be refused by CrossEx risk checks or
  by the exchange. The private stream reports the outcome.

## Account and mode dimensions

Do not collapse account system, logical account identity, position mode, margin
mode, and leverage into one “account mode.” They are separate dimensions. The
central [venue and account-mode reference](venues.md)
records their exchange-specific differences.

| Dimension | Question it answers | Exchange behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account system | Which venue balance/risk system is queried? | Uses the selected row's documented account API; it does not migrate or switch the account. |
| Logical account identity | Which owner, subaccount, or indexed account is queried? | Comes from the typed config and, where supported, an explicit identity option. |
| Position mode | Is the Perp account net/one-way or hedge/multi-side? | Preserves only the scopes documented for the selected row; there is no common mode setter. |
| Margin mode | Is risk cross, isolated, unified, or venue-managed? | Uses the row's documented fixed or current mode; there is no common margin-mode setter. |
| Leverage | Can instrument leverage be changed? | Perp exposes `SetLeverage`; `Effective=0` means the call succeeded but the venue has no instrument leverage setting. |

## Errors and unsupported behavior

All normalized failures use `exchange.Error` kinds with safe details. Transport
failure after a possible write may return `exchange.ErrAmbiguousOutcome`;
callers must not convert it into a blind retry. A method-level platform gap uses
`exchange.ErrUnsupported` and is documented in the centralized venue table.
Credentials, signatures, native payloads, and raw request bodies are not part of
the public error contract.
