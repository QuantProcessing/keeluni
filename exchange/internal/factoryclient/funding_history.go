// the walking loaders below exist for the hourly instruments, where 30d is 720
// points and only Binance, Gate and Lighter answer that in a single call.

// Both walks were written after watching the venues truncate, not before. The
// direction each truncates in is the whole point: Bitget pages backwards from
// the newest settlement, so a bounded walk reaches the requested start;
// Hyperliquid answers forwards from the requested start, so an unwalked 30d
// request ends nine days short of today. A series that stops before the present
// is the one truncation a funding chart cannot absorb, since the recent end is
// what the reader came for.

//     answer oldest-first, Bybit and Bitget newest-first — so normalising here
//     rather than in each loader removes seven chances to get it wrong.
//  2. Drop repeated stamps. Two rates at one instant leave a reader no way to
//     know which was paid, and a chart no way to draw them.
//  3. Measure each interval from the gap to the point before it. No venue
//     publishes the interval alongside a historical rate, and the gap is exact
//     where a hardcoded eight hours would be wrong for everything Hyperliquid
//     and OKX settle hourly.
//  4. Clip to the window — after measuring, so that the first in-window point
//     can take its interval from a pre-window row when the venue returned one.
//     Clipping first would strip the leading point of every series of its
//     interval for no reason other than call order.
