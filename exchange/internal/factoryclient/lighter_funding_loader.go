// LoadFundingHistory reads one market's settled rates.

// Lighter is the only venue addressed by a numeric market id rather than by a
// symbol, so this is the one loader that requires NativeID and says so instead
// of falling back to the canonical spelling — a symbol sent where an integer is
// expected would come back as a parameter error, which reads as "the venue is
// down" rather than "the caller did not resolve the instrument".
//
// The clock is Lighter's: it settles hourly, which is why the resolution is
// stated rather than derived, and why count_back is one row per hour of the
// window. Lighter takes the window in seconds, matching how the candles reader
// in this package addresses the same API family. The endpoint returns at most
// 750 rows, which a thirty-day hourly window (721) fits under.
//
// Two conversions happen here that no other venue needs, and both were settled
// against the live feed because the API reference states units for neither.
//
// The rate is a percentage. Lighter publishes "0.0012" where it means 1.2e-5,
// and three independent readings agree: the row's own value field divided by
// rate/100 lands on the instrument's price; the funding-rates board reports
// 9.6e-05 for the same instrument at the same moment, which is exactly eight
// hourly 1.2e-5 settlements; and read as a fraction the series would imply
// 1051% a year against Hyperliquid's 11% on the same asset over the same week.
//
// The sign lives in direction, not in the rate. Four thousand rows across ten
// markets contained no negative rate string, while direction reported "short"
// on as many as forty percent of them — a funding series that never goes
// negative is not a funding series. "long" is longs paying shorts, the sense in
// which every other venue here reports a positive rate.
