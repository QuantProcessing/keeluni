// TestFundingHistoryRejectsUnsupportedVenue pins where "this venue keeps no
// history" is discovered.
//
// Ten of the eleven board route columns can be charted and Nado cannot, and the
// difference has to surface at construction rather than at read time. A
// connector that built for Nado and then answered with an empty series would
// put a blank chart next to a populated one, which reads as "nothing was paid
// on this leg" — the opposite of the truth, and indistinguishable from a real
// stretch of zero funding. Failing to build instead lets the caller say
// "unsupported" once, in words, beside the leg that can be drawn.
//
// The message is asserted, not just the error, because there are two different
// refusals here and only one of them is about history. Nado and spot are
// profiles the factory recognises — each resolves a scope and a source — and
// they fail at the last gate, on the missing loader. An unknown venue or a
// missing client never gets a profile at all. Asserting the error alone would
// let the first group start failing for the second group's reason, which would
// hide a real regression: a charted venue quietly losing its loader looks
// exactly like a typo in a venue name.
